        </strong>
        I just want to say that I'm really proud of you for clicking on this
        video. By doing that it means that you're willing and wanting to put the
        effort into yourself as well as your health and your future. I really
        hope that this video helps you. Starting in the gym can be overwhelming
        and straight up confusing here's your guide to starting in the gym and
        doing your best to stay consistent. Let's start off with something
        that's personal to you: your goals. In the gym we can go down so many
        different parts, be it CrossFit,
        <strong class="d-block"

          >[video of a big muscular man deadlifting 501 pounds]
        </strong>
        or even my forte: bodybuilding
        <strong class="d-block"
          >[video of Chris Bumstead posing during competition]</strong
        >
        Whatever your goals you should develop a general idea of what it is you
        want to achieve in the gym this will ensure that you're happy in the gym
        doing what you love. It's something that you really should know is that
        your goals may change over time. The gym you choose should be
        environment that you're comfortable with. Unfortunately there should be
        a lot of options available from commercial gyms
        <strong class="d-block"
          >[video of a commercial gym with nautilus machines]</strong
        >
        to very secure private gyms
        <strong class="d-block">[video of a luxury private gym] </strong>
        to even most hardcore gyms.
        <strong class="d-block"
          >[video of a gym cluttered with machines]</strong
        >
        You need to visit a gym that you feel comfortable in and just check it
        out. Most commercial gyms offer a tour or three-day pass to check them
        out. Now that you have these two things under the belt, let's get you
        prepared for the gym. If you have no history in the gym what I would
        suggest is doing some research online. Watch some YouTube video of
        others working out. It may seem a little bit weird but it's a great way
        for you to develop an understanding of the different machines and it's
        also a great way to see the different movements. This brings me on to
        the next step of preparation. Developing your workout routine or split.
        Now again, this is going to entirely depend on your goals, and my forte
        is bodybuilding. So we're going to use bodybuilding as a reference. For
        most beginners I suggest starting on a lower and upper split. Now you're
        probably wondering what that means. It essentially means you're going to
        be dividing the days you're working out by either upper or lower body.
        And here's some examples of it.
        <strong class="d-block"
          >[video of a muscular man in a leg press machine]</strong
        >
        Now this usually works very well for beginners. But if it's not enough,
        the next step I suggest is PPL. Which means Push Pull Legs. All
        synergistic muscle groups are work together. Meaning on push days when
        you try your chest, your shoulders are activated with your triceps.
        <strong class="d-block"
          >[video of Noel training his chest and shoulders]</strong
        >
        And you work your shoulders, your chest and triceps are activated as
        well. This is a great way to develop good mind muscle connection, which
        helps with strength, muscle growth, and a good understanding of your
        body. Here are some examples of PPL. Now that you've got your plan let's
        talk about your first day. Depending on how anxious you feel about
        working out around others I suggest going a time and you feel
        comfortable. Gyms are generally less busy around 10 to 2 p.m, and from 7
        pm to closing time. So now you're at the gym doing your first exercises.
        <strong class="d-block"
          >[video of a man adjusting a machine in a commercial gym]</strong
        >
        Don't worry about what weight you use. Even if you put it on the
        lightest weight to simply just feel how the machines feel. And you can
        do this forever how long you need until you feel comfortable. Now when
        you're ready increase the weight slightly, then go for around 10 to 12
        Reps for four sets each. Do this for each and every exercise and then
        you can move on reps meaning the amount of times you do a single
        movement of an exercise. Sets being the number of times that you do the
        group of repetitions. Now there's a few things I want you to remember on
        day one. The gym is a place we should all feel comfortable. All the
        people in the gym have been in the same position that you are. Just
        starting out and they understand what it feels to be in that position.
        If you feel more comfortable being in the gym with someone else it's a
        great way to start out too. Speak to a friend, colleague or family
        member and see if they're willing to start on this journey with you. So
        some times gone by now and you're moving forward in your journey. Now
        you're probably asking how do I stay motivated? How do I keep going to
        the gym even if I don't feel like it? One thing you have to remember is
        that the gym is a lifestyle change. It's a slow and beautiful process
        that you should enjoy. Remind yourself of why you're doing this. It's a
        time for you to focus on yourself. But nonetheless establishing the Gym
        to your routine is a great way to stay consistent. Go every day at the
        same time and even on the days you don't feel like it give yourself the
        opportunity and still go. Even if you don't give a hundred percent
        something is still better than nothing. That consistency is going to
        make it easier over time and ingrain it into your lifestyle. The gym
        will truly change your life, and if you feel this video helped you,
        please leave a like or a comment or whatever you feel so that we can get
        this video to see as many people as possible. Thank you so much for
        watching. See you next time.
